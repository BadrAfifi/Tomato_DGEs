What to do if you have no replicates
edgeR is primarily intended for use with data including biological replication. Nevertheless,
RNA-Seq and ChIP-Seq are still expensive technologies, so it sometimes happens that only
one library can be created for each treatment condition. In these cases there are no replicate
libraries from which to estimate biological variability. In this situation, the data analyst is
faced with the following choices, none of which are ideal. We do not recommend any of
these choices as a satisfactory alternative for biological replication. Rather, they are the best
that can be done at the analysis stage, and options 2â€“4 may be better than assuming that
biological variability is absent.
